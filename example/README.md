# Dolby.io - Millicast Interactivity SDK - Example

This [index.html](index.html) file in this folder contains a very basic example of application using the _Dolby Millicast Interactivity SDK_, to run a bi-directional conversation in between participants. Use the [audio.html](audio.html) for an audio only experience.

To run the application, either upload it on a web server with SSL enabled (Only HTTPS is allowed for a Web RTC application to work) or run a local web server. Here is how to run it using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
